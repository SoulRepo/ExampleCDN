# ExampleCDN
ExampleCDN is a project for a quick content delivery network (or CDN) to fetch files and
changelogs. Currently, I have only implemented the program in Batch (windows CMD), but
as I learn more computer programming, this CDN will be updated eventually.
## How to use
1: Fork the project
2: Rename it to a GitHub Pages link.
2.1: If there is already a link, delete the old link or copy the files to the repo.
3: Add your content.
4: Add the CDN in your program.
5: Test it, it should work.
